         The contents of the iOS device's Document directory are backed up by iTunes during backup of an iOS device.
         Therefore, the user can recover the data written by your app from an earlier device backup.
         
         The Document directory path on an iOS device is different from the one used for the iOS Simulator.
         
         To obtain the Document directory path, you use the NSSearchPathForDirectoriesInDomains function.
         However, this function was created originally for Mac OS, where multiple such directories could exist.
         Therefore, it returns an array of paths rather than a single path.
         
         For iOS, the resulting array's first element (index=0) contains the path to the Document directory.
